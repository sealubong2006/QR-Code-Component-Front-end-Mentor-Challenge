## Overview
This is a challenge by front-end mentor to design a qr code component 

## My process
i started by making the main body a flex box then the qr code component container a grid box with only two rows with each row having his own div in which i then well defined and styled using classes before adding the necessary components then used media queries to adjust the mobile responsiveness
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
### Continued development
Though i would to be focusing on css specificity and the use of gridbox and flexbox more along side with some css layouts like paddings and margins

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for learnig how to center items in a gridbox . I really liked it and will be using it going forward
